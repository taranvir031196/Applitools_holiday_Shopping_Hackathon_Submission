This is my Submission for the Applitools Holiday Shopping Hackathon.

#About the Project-:
This is a Maven project which is used to run and configure the Applitools Visual Eyes and generate reports on the Applitools dashboard containing the visual comaprisons and validations for various tests ran.

Also Integrated a CustomizedPDF client which can generate the PDF Reports for various Functional validations.
